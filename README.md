# Just playing around with Android Things, Kotlin, and Brio Trains

## About the app/project

First, at Google I/O 2018 they were giving away 
[Android Things Starter Kits](https://androidthings.withgoogle.com/#!/kits/starter-kit) as part of a scavenger hunt.

Second, again at Google I/O 2018, at all the Android sessions it was just Kotlin Kotlin Kotlin on all the coding
screenshots and live demos -- I seriously saw more Python code onscreen than I did Java.

... more later ... this is just the first commit, to create the repo ...
