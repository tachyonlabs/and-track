# Just playing around with Android Things, Kotlin, and Brio Trains

## About the app/project

1. At Google I/O 2018 they were giving away 
[Android Things Starter Kits](https://androidthings.withgoogle.com/#!/kits/starter-kit) as part of a scavenger hunt.

2. Again at Google I/O 2018, at all the Android sessions it was just Kotlin Kotlin Kotlin on all the coding
screenshots and live demos -- I seriously saw more Python code projected on the screens than I did Java.

3. 

... more later ... I'm just getting started here ...

## Notes

Thanks to [https://github.com/androidthings/contrib-drivers/tree/master/rainbowhat](https://github.com/androidthings/contrib-drivers/tree/master/rainbowhat) 
for Rainbow HAT programming examples.

Apologies for messy Kotlin code ... will clean up later ...
